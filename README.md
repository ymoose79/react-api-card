# Frontend Assessment

## Framework
    - React:  
        I used React & redux. I've been using React exclusivly for the past month and a bit (majority of jobs use React), so it's fresher in my mind. However I've used and prefer Svelte.  Had it been a little fresher in my mind I would have gone that route, but I set myself up on a timeline and I wanted to get this knocked out as quick as possible.

## Dependencies
    - Bootstrap
    - Font Awesome
    - Redux toolkit

## Time
    - I spent between 2-3 days on this project.  I wanted to be done by Sunday night, however I took the morning to clean up the code a little bit more, make some minor UI adjustments and do this read me.

## Struggles
    - Tag Search:
        This threw me.  I figured at some point I was going to need to add a store to access this data.  It took me a while to figure out the process (thank you toolkit) and from there it was only a matter of time until I figured out the logic.  I wound up handling some of that on the front end which wound up cluttering up my StudentCard folder. 
    
    - StudentCard:
         If I could be quick about it, I would try and throw that logic into a helper file than import functions to clean up my code.  But I'm sticking to the timeline I set for myself and I want to get this in.

    - SearchBars:
        I noticed the sticky functionality late, wound up kicking that can down the road and for the life of me I couldn't figure out a quick fix.  I've got the scroll bar attached to the container that holds all UI components which is where I believe the heart of the matter is.  

    - App.css file
        The place where I'm doing my mentorship looks at this as cheating, or at the very least, sloppy code. I'm not entirely sure why, but I use the CSS sheet to help override some of the bootstrap baked in styling.  I know there's a way to do this using Sass, I believe.  I explored that avenue for an hour that moved forward with what I know.
